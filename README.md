# PREDICTING STUDENT'S DROPOUT AND ACADEMIC SUCCESS


A major indicator of likely hitches in the higher education system is attributed to the enormous 
 number of student dropouts in the early academic years.
 A careful analysis of the existing data set holds several demographic and socioeconomic factors
 regarding different students and their eventual successful completion or not of programs in a given higher institution. 
 To better understand the obstacles responsible for these dropouts, the data are processed using 
 machine learning methods such as decision trees and random forests. The results indicate that machine learning can 
 predict the likelihood of success for a student (i.e. graduate) however, the models suffer from an imbalance in the data class of the 
 dataset.
